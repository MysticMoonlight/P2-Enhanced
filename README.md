# FAQ
### Where is BLT2/SuperBLT/BeardLib based mods?
BLT2/SuperBLT/BeardLib will **NOT** be supported. Due to BLT based mods does not support other platforms like Linux (It uses DLL which isn't supported on Linux platform), we decided not to include it. We always prefer mods which supports multi-platform(Windows/macOS/Linux), so unless BLT developers add support for Linux, it will never going to be added.
